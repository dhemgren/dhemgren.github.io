                    <p>I am a 31 year old Swede from Tällberg, Dalarna finishing up my final year of studies at the Degree Programme in Computer Science and Engineering at KTH in Stockholm. Next semester marks the beginning of my master thesis in software engineering and I am currently looking for companies to discuss possible thesis subjects with. I spend most of my free time on coffee and various creative outlets, be it coding,  making music or drawing. I really enjoy the problem solving aspect of programming and often try to challenge myself to learn something new when working on projects. I'm holding on for dear life to my beginners mind.</p>

                    <p>The first 5/6 (which could be either an odd time signature or 0.83f depending on who you ask) of my life revolved around music. I spent a few years studying sound design and jazz drums, after which I made a modest living as a musician around Gothenburg. Dabbling with synthesizers got me into the wonderful world of programming.</p>
