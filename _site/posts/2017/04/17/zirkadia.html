    <h2>The elevator pitch</h2>

<p>Zirkadia is a 2D platformer that throws the player into a randomly generated Metroidvanian dungeon (as in <em>you need this to go there but have to visit that other room first to get that one thing</em>). Where it differs from the Castlevanias of yore is in it&#39;s &quot;run&quot;-based focus. The player will mostly likely know within 10 minutes if the current run will succeed or not, and a succesful run (the player reaches the big bad end boss and defeats it) will stretch no longer than 30 minutes. Rooms, enemies and items are shuffled each time the player dies, and the game will have a difficulty that makes a completed run a cause for celebration. The goal will be to deliver a just-one-more-run-experience akin to Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne. A scoring system will be put in place with a score depending on finishing time, life left and item acquisition and an online leaderboard will be hosted.</p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s a whip made of lightning. <em>Lightning</em>.</p>

<em>Eat lightning, tacky demon-lamp-thing!</em></p>

<h2>Where? When?</h2>

<p>The game is initially targetting Windows 10 and OSX. I started working on the game with mobile platforms in mind, but have settled on developing for desktop platforms as this will allow me to incorporate gamepad support as a core feature without having to cater to touchscreens. </p>

<p>The current roadmap consists of a playable build of the game happening sometime during late fall / winter of 2017, after which a three month playtesting phase will commence ending in a first release early 2018.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>The game is being developed in Unity and I&#39;m doing all of the content creation myself. My way of rationalizing this, besides everything being so gosh darn fun to dabble with, is that it will do me good to have tried my hand at all walks of game creation to better understand what future team members are doing. </p>

<p>95% of the code is written from scratch in C#, with the dungeon itself being generated via a custom iterative DFS-algorithm that guarantees that all rooms are reachable and items are being placed sensibly. Alot of work has been put into giving the game an authentic, lofi-pixely feel that for all intents and purposes conveys a pixel perfect experience to the player, including manipulating render textures to pixelate individual objects (like the line renderer for the lightning) and incorporating a pixel grid to which all sprites are quantized.</p>
