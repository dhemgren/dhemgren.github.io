I am a 29 year old swede from TÃ¤llberg, Dalarna currently finishing up my third year at the Degree Programme in Computer Science and Engineering at KTH in Stockholm. Next semester marks the beginning of my studies towards a master degree in computer graphics. I can't wait to get started. I spend most of my free time on coffee and various creative outlets, be it working on games, making music or drawing. I really enjoy the problem solving aspect of programming and often try to challenge myself to learn something new when working on projects. I'm holding on for dear life to my beginners mind.

The first 5/6 (which could be either an odd time signature or 0.83f depending on who you ask) of my life revolved around music. I spent a few years studying sound design and jazz drums, after which I made a (very) modest living as a musician around Gothenburg. Dabbling with synthesizers got me into the wonderful world of programming and my interest in music slowly but surely got replaced by coding. 

I have solid experience with

- C (..and currently working on C++)
- C#
- Java
- Git
- Unity
- libgdx / Box2D
- Sound engineering

I have dabbled with	

- Javascript and developing for Android
- HTML
- Unreal Engine 4
- SQL (mainly PostgreSQL)
- Haskell
- Prolog
