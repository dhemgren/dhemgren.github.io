## Implementing SSSP algorithms on GPUs using CUDA

We are currently studying various single source shortest path-algorithms such as Dijkstra, Delta-Stepping and Bellman-Ford on single- / multi-core CPUs and GPGPUs. Our final goal for the project is to successfully implement Dijkstra Strip-Mined Relaxation (DSMR) on the CUDA platform and compare our results to running DSMR on many-core data clusters.
