description: Zirkadia is a Unity-based desktop game I've been working on from time to time during my years at KTH. It has been a way for me to solidify my understanding of certain branches of  mathematics and algorithm design by applying them in a sandbox setting, be it by rendering lightning through bezier curves, generating levels via my own DFS-based algorithms or performing vector calculations when writing enemy AI.<br><br><br><img src="img/portfolio/mapweb.png" style="border-radius:25px;" class="img-responsive img-centered"> The map is generated in such a way that the player needs to progress by finding each key in a randomly generated sequence. The first room initially holds one or several locked doors and one open door. Behind the open door is a dungeon which holds the key to one of the locked doors. Initially, only visited rooms are visible on the map. On the map generated above, key rooms and points of interest are marked on the map. The map is generated in such a way that room depth can be varied upon initialization. All rooms that are not key rooms or points of interest are then randomized invidiually to provide an almost fully random map each playthrough. <br><br><br><img src="img/portfolio/lightningweb.gif" style="border-radius:25px;" class="img-responsive img-centered"> I do all asset creation myself, which has proved to be the biggest time sink of the project by far. I have considered putting together a team to finish the project, and will look into it further after getting my degree at KTH.
